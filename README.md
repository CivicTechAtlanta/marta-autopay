Worried about running out of rides on your Breeze card? Worry no more. Simply sign up for our service
and we'll ensure you're always topped off and automatically charge your credit card when you need more.

## How to Use

## Caveats

Version 1 makes several assumptions:

- You must already have an account on the Breeze service. [Register Here](https://is.breezecard.com/marta/)
- You should have exactly one card registered on your account (more than one card causes "undefined behavior")
- You should have exactly one credit card on file (more than one causes "undefined behavior")
- You should have exactly one address on file, which is the billing address of the credit card (more than one causes "undefined behavior")
